        <h2 class="section-title">Welcome to BANANA'S Blog !!!</h2>
        <p>This is where I capture and share my adventures and struggles. Approaching my 30s, I plan to write down every moment, so one day, I can share these stories with my future children as if we were peers.</p>
        <p>The world is huge and time is limited, so I try to embrace it all with an open heart and an adventurous spirit. As I continue walking this path, I invite you to join me on a journey of self-discovery and growth. Be my trusted companion as I share the highs and lows of life, and let's cherish every moment together. Thank you for being part of this incredible ride! </p>
